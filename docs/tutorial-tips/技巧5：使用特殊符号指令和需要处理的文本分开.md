不管是資訊總結，還是資訊提取，你一定會輸入大段文字，甚至多段文字，此時有個小技巧。

可以用 “”“ 將指令和文字分開。根據我的測試，如果你的文字有多段，增加 ”“” 會提升 AI 反饋的準確性（這個技巧來自於 OpenAI 的 API [最佳實踐文件](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-openai-api)）

:::info 
感謝 CraneHuang6 的提醒，這裡還能用 ### 符號區隔，不過我一般會用 “”“ ，因為我有的時候會用 # 作為格式範例，太多 # 的話 prompt 會看起來比較暈 😂
:::

像我們之前寫的 prompt 就屬於 Less effective prompt。為什麼呢？據我的測試，主要還是 AI 不知道什麼是指令，什麼是待處理的內容，用符號分隔開來會更利於 AI 區分。
