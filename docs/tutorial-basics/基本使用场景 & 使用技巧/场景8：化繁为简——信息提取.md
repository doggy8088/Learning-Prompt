## 場景介紹

介紹完資訊總結，再聊聊資訊提取，我認為這個場景是繼場景3推理以外，第二個值得深挖的場景。這個場景有非常多的有意思的場景，比如：

1. 將一大段文字，甚至網頁裡的內容，按要求轉為一個表格。按照這個思路你可以嘗試做一個更智慧的，更易懂的爬蟲外掛。
2. 按照特定格式對文章內的進行資訊歸類別。

第二個可能比較難理解，舉個 OpenAI 裡的[例子](https://platform.openai.com/playground/p/DoMbgEMmkXJ5xOyunwFZDHdg?model=text-davinci-003)，它的 prompt 是這樣的（為了有足夠空間顯示內容，我僅節選了 text 裡的部分內容，完整內容，可以[點選這裡](https://platform.openai.com/playground/p/DoMbgEMmkXJ5xOyunwFZDHdg?model=text-davinci-003)檢視）：

Applications with OpenAI Codex
Codex is now powering 70 different applications across a variety of use cases through the OpenAI API.

May 24, 2022
4 minute read
OpenAI Codex, a natural language-to-code system based on GPT-3, helps turn simple English instructions into over a dozen popular coding languages. Codex was released last August through our API and is the principal building block of GitHub Copilot.

Warp is a Rust-based terminal, reimagined from the ground up to help both individuals and teams be more productive in the command-line.

Terminal commands are typically difficult to remember, find and construct. Users often have to leave the terminal and search the web for answers and even then the results might not give them the right command to execute. Warp uses Codex to allow users to run a natural language command to search directly from within the terminal and get a result they can immediately use.

“Codex allows Warp to make the terminal more accessible and powerful. Developers search for entire commands using natural language rather than trying to remember them or assemble them piecemeal. Codex-powered command search has become one of our game changing features.”

—Zach Lloyd, Founder, Warp


Machinet helps professional Java developers write quality code by using Codex to generate intelligent unit test templates.

Machinet was able to accelerate their development several-fold by switching from building their own machine learning systems to using Codex. The flexibility of Codex allows for the ability to easily add new features and capabilities saving their users time and helping them be more productive.

“Codex is an amazing tool in our arsenal. Not only does it allow us to generate more meaningful code, but it has also helped us find a new design of product architecture and got us out of a local maximum.”

—Vladislav Yanchenko, Founder, Machinet"""
```

Prompt 有點長，我解釋下，它是讓 AI 將文章裡的重點內容進行抽離，並將其根據特定格式進行輸出。要求將文章裡提到的公司、人名、主題都按照 comma separated list（按逗號空格分開）的方式羅列出來。

最後的 output 是這樣的：

```other
Company names: OpenAI, Microsoft, GitHub, Pygma, Replit, Warp, Machinet
People names: Emile Paffard-Wray, Amjad Masad, Zach Lloyd, Vladislav Yanchenko
Specific topics: GPT-3, OpenAI API, Azure OpenAI Service, GitHub Copilot, Pygma, Replit, Warp, Machinet
General themes: Natural language-to-code, Productivity, Problem solving, Creativity, Learning
```

## **技巧6：透過範例來闡述需要輸出的格式**

上述的案例，就是用到了這個技巧。這個技巧是技巧2的變種，比較常用於產生文字場景。其實在場景7種，你也可以用到這個技巧。

假設你想讓 AI 總結一篇非常非常長的文章，並且按照特定格式給你總結，那你可以在文章前面明確輸出的格式（為了不佔用太多顯示空間，我省略了正文內容，你可以在 OpenAI 的 Playground 看到[完整案例](https://platform.openai.com/playground/p/3U5Wx7RTIdNNC9Fg8fc44omi)）。它的意思其實是讓 ChatGPT 按 Topic 總結，每個 Topic 裡按照無序列表（就是裡面那個 -）將每個 Topic 的主要觀點羅列出來。

```other
Summarize the main points of the following speech
Use the following format:
Topic 1: <topic_name_1>
- <point_1>
..
Topic 2: <topic_name_2>
- <point_1>
..
Topic 10: ..

Text: """
Thank you so much, Fred, for that lovely introduction. And thanks to the Atlantic Council for hosting me today.

The course of the global economy over the past two years has been shaped by COVID-19 and our efforts to fight the pandemic. It’s now evident, though, that the war between Russia and Ukraine has redrawn the contours of the world economic outlook. Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked attack on Ukraine and its people is taking a devastating human toll, with lives tragically lost, families internally displaced or becoming refugees, and communities and cities destroyed.
...

"""
```

Output 是這樣的：

```other
Topic 1: The war in Ukraine
- The war is taking a human toll with lives lost, families displaced, and communities destroyed
- The Biden administration is committed to holding Russia accountable
- The war has violated international law and is a challenge to the international order

Topic 2: The global economy
- The war is having negative impacts on the global economy, including higher commodity prices and inflation
- The IMF and World Bank will be focused on helping developing countries weather the impacts of the war
- The ultimate outcome for the global economy depends on the path of the war
```

關於這個場景和技巧，我想再解釋一下為什麼潛力很大。根據我使用各種 Summary 或者資訊提取的產品，我發現，AI 並不知道什麼是重點，所以在總結的過程中，會丟失很多內容。如何引導 AI 進行總結，就變得非常重要，且具有一定的可玩性。
